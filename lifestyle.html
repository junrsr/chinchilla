            <h3>A good diet.</h3>
            <p style="text-align: left;">The RSPCA suggests that I should have constant access to clean water and good quality hay. I naturally eat grasses, leaves and twigs, but hay will do! Futhermore, I should be given a small amount of grass-based chinchilla pellets daily to protect my teeth. I <em>should</em> only get dried fruits and root vegetables as treats but feel free to give them more frequently.</p>

            <h3>The correct environment.</h3>
            <p>The size and temperature of anywhere I'm kept needs to be appropriate, ideally in well ventilated, dry areas between 10-18ÂºC. I'd love to have large, secure living environemnts with plenty of space to jump about and run around, whilst also having a quiet space away from other pets due to my prey nature. I'd love to have some non-plastic toys to play with and obviously a tray filled with chinchilla dust so I can take a bath.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">Building on this, a clean, safe, secure, hazard-free environment would really be ideal. This means regularly cleaning my cage, constant access to enough nest boxes to sleep and keep me warm, and a hiding place in case I feel afraid. At the end of the day, I just want to feel comfortable and safe.</p>

            <h3>Welfare checks.</h3>
            <p>It might be hard to tell if I'm in pain. I'm not very good at showing outwards signs of this, so a lot of my suffering may go unnoticed. Because of this, you should check for illness daily, including looking for sore feet, wetness around eyes/mouth and fur loss. If so, contact a vet immediately. Changes in normal behaviour patters could also be a early sign of illness.</p>
